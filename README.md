# aws-flask-agenda
Simple RESTful service developed using Python's flask to keep track of my assignments/tasks.

### Overview

This is a simple project I am working on to learn a little bit more about web and also use AWS 
for more than my personal website. The end result of this will be on AWS and I will include the
guide I used for that at the end of this. Feel free to use this yourself as it is a really cool 
and fun way to have an agenda. Also feel free to edit this and make it better because who doesn't
love better services???
